## Frisco reservation app

Simple frisco reservation app based on selenium, that opens the frisco websites, logs in the user and looks for the closest free delivery date in specified month. 

This will make a call each specified minutes (cron variable) until reservation is made.  

Basic logging and email reservation conformation included

For configuration see envexample file. 

note: app developed for linux system, for windows you must download the windows chrome driver. 

note: Current reservation in frisco needs to be hidden / saved to clipboard, so the frisko shows possible delivery dates and not the current active delivery date
